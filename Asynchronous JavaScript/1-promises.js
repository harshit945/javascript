// promises basically has three stages 
// 1 - Pending : When you placed your order you have to wait for sometime
// 2 - FullFill : When your order is ready
// 3 - Rejected : When order is not fulfiled

// Promise is considered to be settled if its in one of these two stages one is fullfill or rejected else its in pending stage
